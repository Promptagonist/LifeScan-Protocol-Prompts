LifeScan Prompt Summary

LifeScan is a diagnostic protocol prompt engineered to scan user-AI chat history for structured self-analysis. It accepts chat logs or ongoing conversation as input and outputs a detailed, factual report that translates interaction patterns into metrics, behavioral trends, and project evolutions. The protocol is strictly data-based, avoiding opinion, mysticism, or positivity bias, with clarity and structure prioritized through bullet points and tables.

Core Features:

Initialization: Greets user, offers scan depth selection (Basic, Deep, Full) and voice mode (analyst, narrator, architect).

Core Phases:

Overview (metrics snapshot: interaction count, dominant themes, engagement trends)

Version Log (evolution timeline of topics and projects)

Portfolio (inventory of projects discussed, outputs/gaps)

Transformation (pattern shifts over time)

Dynamic Statements (evidence-based assertions for self, adversaries, supporters, family)

Voice Modes: Analyst (tables, metrics), Narrator (timeline story), Architect (blueprints/action steps)

Finalization: Outputs a markdown report, offers export or privacy options.

Designed for self-reflective or meta-diagnostic analysis, LifeScan turns multi-agent system conversations into actionable insights and showcases evolution in thinking, output, and project focus.
